            %i.i96.chat
          Staying in touch with your team even in remote or disconnected situations is key for successful collaboration. You don’t need to adapt to existing chat tools neither build your custom application from scratch. mBuilder will let you define exactly the behaviour you need for your group chat. You can add and change commands as you learn from what works best for your team.

          Having timely, reliable, quality data on your programs is the first step to understanding what’s going on. With mBuilder you can build a customized data collection application and store each piece of data in tables designed by you. These data can be integrated with other apps or viewed online in real-time. Use your own formats, try different things and even have coexisting different methods tailored to different users.

        %p
          %span
            %i.i96.social
          In many situations, enabling sparse communities to have a digital space where they can share best practices, tips or keep each other updated on what they are doing is all you need for social change. You can build your own Twitter in minutes with mBuilder and have it work in any setting.

      .span6
        %h2 Event notifications
        %p
          %span
            %i.i96.event
          Do you want to keep a broad range of people notified about different events? Your users could subscribe by sending an SMS with a few keywords indicating the topics they are interested in. You could push notifications to interested users by simply sending an SMS with those same keywords.
